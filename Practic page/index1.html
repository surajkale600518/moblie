            <b>Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale</b> Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale;
            Marathi pronunciation: [d͡ʒiˑ bʱoˑs(ə)leˑ]; c.19 February 1630 3
            April 1680[5]) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle
            Maratha clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from
            the declining Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis
            of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Shivaji
            Shahaji Bhonsale of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7]

            The Bijapur sultanate was displeased with their losses to Shivaji's
            forces, with their vassal Shahaji disavowing his son's actions.
            After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of
            the young Ali Adil Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government
            became more stable, and turned its attention towards Shivaji.[42] In
            1657, the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal
            Khan, a veteran general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the
            Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani Temple, a holy site for
            Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major
            pilgrimage site for Hindus.[43][44][45] Pursued by Bijapuri forces,
            Shivaji retreated to Pratapgad fort, where many of his colleagues
            pressed him to surrender.[46] The two forces found themselves at a
            stalemate, with Shivaji unable to break the siege, while Afzal Khan,
            having a powerful cavalry but lacking siege equipment, was unable to
            take the fort. After two months, Afzal Khan sent an envoy to Shivaji
            suggesting the two leaders meet in private, outside the fort, for
            negotiations.[47][48]
