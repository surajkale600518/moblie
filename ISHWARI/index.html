          This fort is surrounded by steep upwards slopes from all four sides
          and is unassailable. There is small temple of Goddess Shivai and idols
          of Jijabai (Mother of Shri Shivaji) and Shivaji in his childhood. The shape 
          of Shivneri fort is like Shiv-Pind (Shivaâ€™s sacred symbol; Divine Phallus).
          This fort is visible as soon as you enter Junnar town.
          This fort is not that big in area. Dr. John Friar of East India Company visited this fort in 1673. He has mentioned in his book that, this fort can hoard sufficient food to
          meet the needs of one thousand families enough to last for 7 years. </p>

          The present day Junnar was known as Jirna-nagar, Junner and existed prior
          to beginning of year AD. Junnar was capital of King Nahapan from Shak dynasty.
          The Satvahan king Satkarni, a son of Gautami, wiped out Shakas and held dominance 
          over Junnar and its surrounding area. Naneghat was commercial 
          route in olden times. Lot of traffic used to pass on this route. </p>
        <p>
          To supervise this traffic the fort was built on this route. 
          After Satvahan rule stabilised, they excavated many caves. After Satvahan, 
          Shivneri fort came under the control of Chalukya of Rashtrakut Empire.
          Yadavas established their rule between 1170 to 1308. During this tenure
          Shivneri was built as a fort. In 1443 Malik Ul Tujar defeated Yadavas and
          conquered the fort.Thus the fort came under the control of Bahamani Empire. </p>

          In 1493 AD the capital was shifted from this fort to Ahamadnagar. In 1565 
          Sultan Murtija Nizam held his brother Kasim as captive on this fort. In 1595 
          this fort and area surrounding it came under the control of Maloji Raje Bhosale. When Jijamata was pregnant, she was shifted to Shivneri fort during night under protection of 500 strong cavalry. Jijamata made took a vow before Goddess Bhavani Shivai on Shivneri fort, that if she begets son she will
           name him after Goddess. Shri Shivaji Raje was born on 19th February 1630. </p>
        <p>
          The fort went under the control of Mughals in 1637. Fishermen rebelled against Mughals in 1650, but Mughals won the battle. In 1673, Shivaji Maharaj made unsuccessful attempt conquer the fort by winning over the fort chieftain Ajijkhan and surrounding the fort. In the year 1678, the Junnar area was pillaged and Maratha army made unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort. After the gap of 40 years, in 1716 Shahu Maharaj brought the fort under
           the control of Maratha Empire and thereafter it was handed over to Peshvas.</p>
        <p>
          In 1443 Malik Ul Tujar defeated Yadavas and conquered the fort. Thus the fort came under the control of Bahamani Empire. In 1470 Malik Mahammad, representative of Malik Ul Tujar, surrounded and conquered it again.
           In 1446 Nizamshahi was established after the death of Malik Mahammad.</p>
